# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Mitchell.

<!--
This animation was generated using `asciinema` and `svg-term` (and a lot of work in vim to make the timings smooth).
If you want to do this yourself, 
  :'<,'>s/[0-9.]\+/\=printf("%.2g", INCREMENT*(line(".") - line("'<")) + START_TIME)
is going to be your friend on replacing the timings and making them consistent

I'm a student at the University of Washington's [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.uw.edu).
Since most of my non-class work ends up here one way or another, it's essentially my portfolio.
Feel free to have a look around!
