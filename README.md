# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Mitchell.

<!--
This animation was generated using `asciinema` and `svg-term` (and a lot of work in vim to make the timings smooth).
If you want to do this yourself, 
  :'<,'>s/[0-9.]\+/\=printf("%.2g", INCREMENT*(line(".") - line("'<")) + START_TIME)
is going to be your friend on replacing the timings and making them consistent

I'm a software engineer at Microsoft, and I recently graduated from the University of Washington's [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.uw.edu).
I'm interested in all things "in the weeds," especially OS/drivers/virtualiztion, and I also am interested in formal verification and its use in industrial projects.
Since much of work ends up here one way or another, it's essentially my portfolio.
Feel free to have a look around!
